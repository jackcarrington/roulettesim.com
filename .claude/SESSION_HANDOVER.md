# Claude Code Session Handover

## Current Status: Color Scheme Decision Pending

### What We Just Completed ‚úÖ
1. **Button System Overhaul**: Fixed contrast issues and implemented site-wide consistency
   - Updated `/src/assets/scss/base/_button.scss` with proper light/dark mode colors
   - Unified all game card buttons to use `.button` class (GameGridPro.tsx, GameLibrary.astro)
   - Added modern hover effects with shadows and subtle animations
   - Maintained brand colors while fixing accessibility

2. **Typography System Optimization**: 
   - Reduced all heading levels by 1 (h1-h5 scale)
   - Maintained semantic +1 line-height pattern
   - Removed unused h6 level

3. **Roulette Rules Cheat Sheet**: 
   - Created comprehensive tool at `/tools/roulette-rules-cheat-sheet`
   - Implemented mobile-responsive design with Tailwind
   - Added SEO structured data and print-friendly styles
   - Updated links in strategy content to point to new location

4. **Design System Documentation**: 
   - Added comprehensive guidelines to `/CLAUDE.md`
   - Documented button system rules and consistency requirements
   - Created component integration priority hierarchy

### Current Issue: User Wants Color Change üé®

**Problem**: User dislikes the current pink/purple primary color (`#d648ff`) but loves the green secondary (`#00d1b7`)

**Status**: Created color test page at `http://localhost:4321/color-test` showing 5 accessible options:

1. **Casino Classic** ‚≠ê (Recommended) - `#dc2626` red + current green
2. **Navy & Teal** - `#1e40af` navy + current green  
3. **Slate & Teal** - `#475569` slate + current green
4. **Indigo & Teal** - `#6366f1` indigo + current green
5. **Green Harmony** - `#166534` forest + current green

**Next Step**: 
- User needs to visit color-test page and choose preferred option
- Once decided, update `--brand-primary` in `/src/assets/scss/base/_root.scss`
- Remove color-test page after implementation
- Test all components with new colors

### Files Modified in This Session

### Git Status
Last commit: `1d1ec42` - "Improve button system with fixed contrast and site-wide consistency"
All changes pushed to `main` branch at https://github.com/jackcarrington/roulettesim.com

### Current Brand Colors (To Be Updated)
```scss
--brand-primary: #d648ff;   // üí• USER DISLIKES - needs replacement
--brand-secondary: #00d1b7; // ‚úÖ USER LOVES - keep this  
--brand-neutral: #b9bec4;   // ‚úÖ Keep unchanged
```

### Key Context for Next Session
- Site uses hybrid Tailwind + SCSS approach (documented as intentional)
- Button consistency is critical - always use `.button` class
- All colors use OKLCH system for automatic light/dark variants
- User values accessibility and professional appearance
- Roulette/casino theme should influence design decisions

### Immediate Next Actions
1. **Priority 1**: Get user's color choice from test page
2. **Priority 2**: Update brand colors in `/src/assets/scss/base/_root.scss`
3. **Priority 3**: Test all components with new colors  
4. **Priority 4**: Remove color-test page and commit final colors
5. **Priority 5**: Consider any other UI improvements

### Development Environment
- Local server: `http://localhost:4321` (npm run dev)
- Color test page: `http://localhost:4321/color-test`
- Cheat sheet tool: `http://localhost:4321/tools/roulette-rules-cheat-sheet`
