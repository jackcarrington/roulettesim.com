# Roulettesim.com Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

• Establish authentic casino game integration with backup partnerships, delivering real roulette experiences vs generic simulations
• Create mobile-first educational platform with diversified traffic strategy, capturing 100K-500K monthly visits
• Build intelligent casino recommendation engine with validated conversion optimization, achieving 8-12% conversion rates  
• Develop YMYL-compliant content authority with algorithm-change resilience for sustainable search rankings
• Generate $100K-$200K monthly affiliate revenue through contractually protected partnerships and optimized user journeys

### Background Context

Roulettesim.com addresses a critical authenticity gap in the roulette simulator market. While competitors like roulette-simulator.info capture significant traffic (159K monthly visits), they fail to bridge users from practice to confident real-money play due to generic implementations and poor conversion optimization. Our solution leverages authentic casino API integration, clinical educational authority, and behavioral intelligence to transform roulette education from entertainment to professional casino preparation, targeting high-intent prospects with $1000+ lifetime value potential.

The platform will serve as the definitive bridge between gambling curiosity and confident real-money play, establishing sustainable competitive advantages through casino partnerships, mobile-first design, and YMYL-compliant educational content that competitors cannot easily replicate.
