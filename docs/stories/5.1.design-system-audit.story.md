# Story 5.1: Design System Audit & Compatibility Matrix

## Story Information

**Epic:** 5 - Brownfield Design System Enhancement
**Story Number:** 5.1
**Status:** Ready for Review

## Story Statement

As a **senior developer**,
I want **comprehensive audit of existing design patterns with compatibility mapping**,
so that **enhancement decisions preserve system stability while identifying improvement opportunities**.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Map relationships between CSS variables and component implementations
- Document current brand color usage (`--brand-primary`, `--brand-secondary`, `--brand-neutral`)
- Identify spacing, typography, and elevation token usage across components
- Create dependency graph showing variable inheritance and fallback patterns

**AC3: Button System Analysis and Migration Path**

- Create performance benchmarks for measuring brownfield enhancement impact

## Dev Notes

### System Architecture Context
[Source: astro.config.mjs, _root.scss analysis, component directory structure]

**Existing Technical Foundation:**
- **Astro 5.8+ SSR Architecture**: Server-side rendering with React islands for interactivity
- **Advanced CSS System**: OKLCH color spaces with automated light-dark mode using `light-dark()` function
- **Path Alias System**: Comprehensive aliases (`@components/*`, `@stores/*`, etc.) for maintainable imports
- **Build Optimization**: Vite with Tailwind CSS 4, terser minification, manual chunk splitting
- **Domain Organization**: Components organized by business domain (`/game/`, `/education/`, `/conversion/`, `/safety/`)

**Current CSS Variable Architecture:**
```scss
// Existing foundation in _root.scss
:root {
  // Brand colors using OKLCH for better color manipulation
  --brand-primary: #1e40af;   // Blue for educational authority
  --brand-secondary: #00d1b7; // Cyan for accent/interaction
  --brand-neutral: #b9bec4;   // Neutral for text/backgrounds

  // Automated palette generation using oklch(from var() l c h)
  --color-primary-100 through --color-primary-500
  --color-secondary-100 through --color-secondary-500
  --color-neutral-100 through --color-neutral-900

  // Semantic color tokens with light-dark() automation
  --foreground-color: light-dark(var(--color-neutral-800), var(--color-neutral-100));
  --background-color: light-dark(var(--color-neutral-100), var(--color-neutral-900));
  // ... full semantic token set
}
```

**Dual Button System Analysis:**
1. **SCSS `.button` System** (`_button.scss`):
   - Used for educational CTAs, navigation, casino recommendations
   - Supports `.color-secondary` and `.has-icon` variants
   - Includes hover animations, focus states, accessibility features
   - Integrated with CSS variable system for theme consistency

2. **Shadcn React Button System** (`/components/ui/button.tsx`):
   - Used for interactive components requiring React state management
   - CVA (class-variance-authority) pattern for variant management
   - Radix UI accessibility foundation with Slot pattern for composition
   - Tailwind CSS classes with custom design token integration

**Component Ecosystem Overview:**
```
src/components/
├── domain-organized directories (game/, education/, conversion/, safety/)
├── ui/ (shared UI components: FeatureCard, GameCard)
├── components/ui/ (Shadcn components: button, card, dialog, etc.)
└── base components (Header, Footer, Navigation, Hero)
```

**State Management Integration:**
- **Nanostores**: Reactive state for game preferences, conversion tracking, user session
- **localStorage**: Session persistence with user consent for GDPR compliance
- **Analytics Service**: Privacy-first tracking integrated with component interactions

**Performance Constraints:**
- **Bundle Size Targets**: Current chunk optimization keeps vendor bundles <100KB
- **Core Web Vitals**: <3s initial load, 90+ mobile PageSpeed scores maintained
- **CSS Optimization**: Inline stylesheets for render-blocking elimination
- **Island Architecture**: Selective hydration for optimal performance

### Testing Standards
[Source: package.json, existing test patterns]

**Current Testing Framework:**
- **Vitest**: Unit testing for services, utilities, and component logic
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing for complete user journeys
- **Axe**: Accessibility testing for WCAG compliance verification
- **TypeScript**: Compile-time validation for component prop interfaces

**Test File Organization:**
- Unit tests: Co-located with source files or `__tests__` directories
- E2E tests: `/tests/e2e/` directory for user journey validation
- Accessibility tests: Integrated with E2E tests using @axe-core/playwright

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Component API documentation must include TypeScript interface validation
- CSS variable dependency mapping requires build-time validation tests
- Button system analysis needs cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance baseline measurement requires automated benchmark testing
