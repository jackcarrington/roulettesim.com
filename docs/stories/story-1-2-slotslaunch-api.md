# Story 1.2: SlotsLaunch API Integration

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** working SlotsLaunch API connection filtering for roulette games only,  
**so that** authentic casino roulette variants can be discovered and cached.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] API authentication with token and Origin header validation implemented
- [x] Rate limiting (2 r/s premium) and client-side caching strategy
- [x] Game filtering by type/theme parameters to exclude slots, identify roulette only
- [x] Game tagging system to classify roulette variants (European/American/French) from API responses
- [x] Enhanced filtering logic to support variant-specific game retrieval
- [x] TypeScript interfaces for roulette game metadata structures
- [x] Error handling with graceful degradation to static content
- [x] Minimum 5-8 roulette variants successfully retrieved and cached

## Dev Notes
- SlotsLaunch API integration implemented via Astro API routes and Netlify Edge Functions
- Caching strategy respects 2 r/s rate limits
- Fallback to mock data when API unavailable

## Testing
- [x] API authentication validation
- [x] Rate limiting compliance test
- [x] Game filtering verification
- [x] Error handling with fallback
- [x] TypeScript interface validation
