# Complete Roulette Rules Guide

Ready to play roulette? Here's exactly what happens: You bet where a ball will land on a spinning wheel. The dealer spins, the ball lands, and winning bets get paid. That's it.

## How to Play Roulette (3 Simple Steps)

1. **Place Your Bets**: Put your chips on the betting layout where you think the ball will land
2. **Dealer Spins**: The wheel spins and the dealer announces "No more bets" - don't touch your chips after this
3. **Get Paid**: If your number or color hits, you win according to the payout odds

**Timing is Everything**: You can place and move bets until the dealer says "No more bets." After that, hands off your chips until the round ends.

## Best Beginner Bets (Start Here)

These bets win almost half the time and are perfect for learning:

**Red or Black**: Bet on the color
- **Payout**: Win $1 for every $1 bet
- **Your odds**: Win about 48% of spins
- **Chip placement**: Put chips in the red or black diamond

**Odd or Even**: Bet on number type  
- **Payout**: Win $1 for every $1 bet
- **Your odds**: Win about 48% of spins
- **Example**: If you bet $5 on "Even" and 24 comes up, you win $5

**High or Low**: Numbers 1-18 (Low) or 19-36 (High)
- **Payout**: Win $1 for every $1 bet  
- **Your odds**: Win about 48% of spins

## Choose Your Game Wisely

**European Roulette**: 37 pockets (0-36)
- **Best choice**: The casino wins less often
- **House edge**: 2.7% (casino advantage)

**American Roulette**: 38 pockets (0, 00, 1-36)  
- **Avoid if possible**: Extra zero hurts your odds
- **House edge**: 5.26% (much worse for players)

**French Roulette**: 37 pockets with player-friendly rules
- **Best odds**: Special rules give money back sometimes
- **House edge**: 1.35% on even-money bets

**Bottom Line**: Always choose European or French over American roulette.

## Getting Started: Betting Basics

**Minimum Bets**: Most casinos start at $1-$5 per bet. Your chips will be a unique color so the dealer knows they're yours.

**Chip Placement**: Put chips directly on numbers or betting areas. Don't worry about exact placement - dealers will help new players.

**When to Stop**: Once the dealer announces "No more bets," keep your hands away from the table until the round ends.

## Common Beginner Mistakes (Avoid These)

1. **Playing American roulette** when European is available - you're giving the casino extra advantage
2. **Touching chips after "no more bets"** - dealers will warn you, but it slows the game  
3. **Betting your entire bankroll** on single numbers - exciting but financially dangerous
4. **Not understanding payouts** - higher payouts mean much lower chances of winning

## Advanced Betting Options

Once you're comfortable with the basics, these bets offer different risk/reward combinations:

### Higher Risk, Higher Reward (Inside Bets)

**Single Number (Straight Up)**: 
- **Payout**: Win $35 for every $1 bet
- **Reality check**: Only hits about 3% of spins
- **Best for**: Small bets for excitement

**Split Bet (Two Numbers)**:
- **Payout**: Win $17 for every $1 bet  
- **Your chances**: About 5% of spins
- **How to bet**: Put chips on the line between two numbers

**Street Bet (Three Numbers)**:
- **Payout**: Win $11 for every $1 bet
- **Your chances**: About 8% of spins  
- **How to bet**: Put chips at the end of any row

### Medium Risk Options

**Dozens** (1-12, 13-24, or 25-36):
- **Payout**: Win $2 for every $1 bet
- **Your chances**: About 32% of spins
- **Good for**: Better odds than single numbers, higher payouts than even-money bets

**Columns** (Vertical columns on layout):
- **Payout**: Win $2 for every $1 bet  
- **Your chances**: About 32% of spins
- **How to bet**: Put chips at the bottom of any column

## Smart Roulette Strategy

### What House Edge Really Means
The casino always has a mathematical advantage - this means they win more money than they pay out over time:

- **European roulette**: Casino keeps about $2.70 for every $100 bet
- **American roulette**: Casino keeps about $5.26 for every $100 bet  
- **Translation**: You lose money faster on American roulette

### Bankroll Management (Critical for Beginners)

**Before You Play:**
- Decide how much you can afford to lose completely
- Never gamble money you need for rent, food, or bills
- Set a time limit - casino atmosphere makes you lose track

**During Play:**
- Start with minimum bets to learn the game
- Don't chase losses with bigger bets - this leads to bigger losses
- Take breaks every 30 minutes to clear your head

**Betting System Reality Check:**
Many players try systems like "double your bet after each loss." These don't work because:
- The house edge stays the same on every spin  
- Bad streaks can wipe out your bankroll quickly
- Past spins don't affect future outcomes

### Best Approach for New Players

1. **Start with European roulette** (better odds)
2. **Stick to even-money bets** (Red/Black, Odd/Even) while learning
3. **Bet small amounts** ($1-5) until you understand the pace
4. **Practice online first** with free demos before risking real money

## Responsible Gambling Guidelines

**Before You Play:**
- Set time and money limits
- Never gamble money you can't afford to lose
- Understand that all casino games favor the house

**During Play:**
- Take regular breaks
- Don't drink alcohol while gambling
- Avoid emotional betting after losses

**Warning Signs:**
- Chasing losses with bigger bets
- Lying about gambling activities
- Neglecting responsibilities to gamble
